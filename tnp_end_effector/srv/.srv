#inputs
# there are two control methods: force_control and position_control
# force_control: closes the gripper using force control: 0 super weak!, 100 maximum force (can damage stuff)
# position_control: closes the gripper to a certain width in millimeters (0 totally close, 110 fully open), use it before grasping an object (i.e., the space is too narrow)
std_msgs/String control_method # choose between force_control and position_control 
std_msgs/Int16 control_parameter # set the force (force_control) or the width (position_control)
